## Hi, I'm Pamela! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Designer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, working remotely for [Betha Sistemas](https://www.betha.com.br/). 

In my spare time, I like to study front-end technologies such as CSS, JavaScript, React.js and Node.

If you would like to discuss about design, tech or other stuff, feel free to contact me.
