## Hi, I'm Pamela! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Product Designer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, working remotely for [Betha Sistemas](https://www.betha.com.br/). 

In my spare time, I like to study front-end technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. Right now, I've been studying Swift (I kinda love iOS apps).

If you would like to discuss about design, tech or other stuff, feel free to contact me.
